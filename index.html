									<h2>Ayesha (s3885706)</h2>
									<p>Ayesha is a Muslim girl, born in Pakistan. She moved to Australia when she was six years old, and moved back to Pakistan after eight-nine years. She owns dual nationalities; Australian and Pakistani. Ayesha now lives with her parents, grandparents (from her father’s side), a younger sister, who is currently doing the same course with her, and a younger brother. She can fluently speak English and Urdu, and knows a little bit of Arabic and Korean too. She has completed her ‘A’ Levels in engineering, and two subjects from Curtin University; ‘Academic and Professional Communications’ and ‘Culture to Cultures’. Ayesha enjoys reading books from time to time, and wishes to own a Persian kitten in the future. Her interest in It began last year, when she began to explore more about what her father does for a living. Her father insisted that she complete a HTML & CSS course from LinkedIn Learning, which helped in increasing her interest in this field. “Writing code is actually better than I thought”, she thought. Ayesha’s goal is to become a UX/UI designer, and the reason for her enrollment in this degree is her interest in IT and her father’s words: “Designers should have a little background knowledge of IT as well. That will help them to create implementable designs and hence, fewer of their designs will be rejected by the developer, making the web development process easier and faster.” </p>

									<h2>Esther (s3880950)</h2>
									<p>Esther is a vibrant and lively person. She comes from a mixed background; her father is Kenyan and her mother, Australian. Esther speaks English but is aiming to learn the Japanese language soon. She owns two huskies, Bear and Lily, and a cat called Felix. Esther was studying to earn a degree in Bachelor of Interior Architecture, but wasn’t able to complete it, and after taking a gap year, developed an interest in criminology and hence began to pursue a degree in that field. Her wish is to join AFP’s cybercrime unit in the future, However, she is impartial to any career involving cyber security. She recently discovered that a little of her interest lays in the field of IT as well, which is why she is taking this unit, Information to IT, as her steps towards a Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology. She believes that having an IT degree is of benefit to understanding the ever-changing technological universe. Another reason that has influenced her decision to commit to an IT degree was her mother, as she works in IT and has nothing but praise for her career.</p>

									<h2>Matthew (s3020028)</h2>
									<p>Matthew is a very creative and practical person. He is the oldest member on the team. Matthew enjoyed a privileged childhood, in a small Victorian country town, Mildura. His parents were horticulturists, both with a Croatian background. Although both his parents spoke Croatian, Matthew was unable to learn the language apart from a few swear words that he used with his cousins! His family had a vineyard, that produced a variety of grapes, and Matthew really enjoyed working on the property along with his siblings. He completed all his primary and secondary education in Mildura, attaining his VCE in 2001. He then moved to Melbourne, where he earned a Diploma in Telecommunications from RMIT. Matthew has completed multiple online IT training courses and has currently started a Degree in IT. He is very interested in the fact that enabled hardware can be connected in a way to provide instant communication to others. “IT has been embedded into me from an early age by my Grandfather who worked with computers and telecommunications during his career” he says. Ever since then, he has been researching the how, why, what, where, and when about IT. Over the last two decades, he has been passionate about building Computer systems, Maintaining Hardware, System Administration, Networking and encapsulating all these elements into home and work networks, hosting game servers and providing advice for family and friends. Apart from his interest in IT, Matthew likes playing the drums. He has taken part in miscellaneous bands that have toured across Australia, releasing a number of albums onto the Interwebs and also thought the drums to high-school students. </p>

									<h2>Moustafa (s3887033)</h2>
									<p>Moustafa, the youngest member on the team, is a 17-year-old, Muslim boy, born and raised in Australia by Iraqi parents. He comes from an Arab tribe called “Taghlib”, which is a branch of the “Rabiah” tribe. His people were a people of disgrace who would die in battle over camels until Allah (SWT) honored them with Islam. Growing up in an Australian-Iraqi environment, Moustafa learnt how to speak the Arabic and English language. He graduated from high-school in September, last year, but decided not to attend the HSC exams as he had different plans in mind for his career. He wanted to pursue a career in the vast field of IT, hence undertaking some online units to do so. Moustafa is a passionate young man, his culture being of much importance to him. He enjoys reading books and going out with friends. Moustafa’s interest in It began in 2017. Growing up, he played a lot of video games including CSGO, so when Intel held their first Extreme Masters in Sydney, he made sure to attend with his friends. There, he enjoyed all the PC Builds, developing interest in them. He did some research and eventually built his own PC, watching YouTube Videos. Since then, he’s always been interested in reading about new technological discoveries. He even took some IT electives in high-school, which he thoroughly enjoyed.
										Fun fact about Moustafa’s tribe: The royal family of Saudi Arabia “Al Saud” and the royal family of Kuwait “Al Sabah” are also from the same tribe as Moustafa, and yet they won’t give his tribe any oil money.
