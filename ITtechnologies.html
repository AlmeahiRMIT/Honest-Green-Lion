								<h2>Autonomous Vehicles</h2>
							<p>Self-driving vehicles are cars or trucks in which human drivers are never required to take
								control to safely operate the vehicle. Also known as autonomous or “driverless” cars, they combine
								sensors and software to control, navigate, and drive the vehicle (Union of Concerned Scientists 2017, para. 1). </p>
							<p>For many years, people have been imagining and pondering over the development of autonomous vehicles and we’ve seen them
								in science fictional movies and TV films/ series like the ‘Knight Rider’, Minority Report, and Batman, etc. But they have
								now become a reality with the introduction of IoT – ‘The Internet of Things’.  Autonomous Vehicles are connected to many
								other things, including the on-board sensors, other vehicles on the road, pedestrian and cyclist smart phones, traffic sensors
								(lights etc.), parking detectors, and much more (basically anything that can be found on the roads). IoT can help improve road
								safety of other vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, and even animals. It can help in increasing the flow of the traffic and prevent
								 traffic jams. Maybe even stopping at a red signal can become rare due to IoT! Driving comfort will increase, with the manoeuvrings
								 and navigation becoming smoother, decreasing the chances of sudden brakes..</p>
								<p>As we move on towards the future, the use autonomous vehicles are increasing. Alphabet Inc. has made autonomous taxis. They held
									 a trial session in California where the taxis successfully relocated over 6,200 people during its first month of use. Ford has also
									 been working on self-driving vehicles, carrying out trials in Detroit, Miami, Pittsburgh, Washington D.C. and Palo Alto. They plan on
									 testing their auto vehicles in Austin soon, to be used for taxis and cargo purposes. Another company who has been very successful in
									 in this field is Tesla. ‘Tesla has supplied customers with more than 780,000 vehicles since launching, the majority of which arrive
									 with pre-installed, self-driving capabilities available to users who purchase the requisite software’ (Harris 2020, Para. 4).  Some
									 other companies that are working on autonomous vehicles include: Walmart, which uses autonomous cargo vehicles to deliver goods, and
									 Pizza Hut, who is collaborating with Toyota to make autonomous delivery vans that will have a kitchen inside so that the chef can make
									 pizzas on the way to the delivery homes. (Harris 2020)</p>
									<p>The use of autonomous vehicles is being encouraged to increase the safety of car users and prevent accidents. There are five levels
										of autonomy: driver assistance, partial driving automation, conditional automation, high automation, and full automation. The first
										two levels are where the human supervises the driving environment and as for the last three levels, the automatic system supervises
										the environment (Synopsis Inc. 2021). Majority of autonomous vehicles are at level two autonomy, partial driving automation. Which
										means that the autonomous system has control of steering, accelerating and decelerating the vehicle (Synopsis Inc. 2021). However,
										constant human monitoring is still required for this level, and hence the vehicle cannot be called driverless.</p>
									<p>Future Agenda Limited (2020) have speculated in their report, ‘The future of autonomous vehicles’, that the future of autonomous
										vehicles may be a “wicked problem”. They have described a wicked problem to be one that has many people and opinions involved, and
										knowledge about that problem is incomplete. It cannot be judged when the level of autonomy will increase from level two to three,
										conditional automation, however it is possible that in the next three years, driverless cars may become a part of the discussion of
										the general public.</p>
										<p>The autonomous vehicle system uses a “sense-plan-act” design. A multiple arrangement of sensors is used to detect and sense the environment, some of which include:
											</p>
							<ul><li>LiDAR (Light detection and ranging)</li>
								<li>Cameras</li>
								<li>Radar</li>
								<li>Infrared</li>
								<li>Ultrasonic</li>
								</ul>
							<p>(Anderson et al. 2016)</p>
											<p>A combination of sensors working together reduces the chances of error. The most difficult part to implement in the process of the
												development of autonomous vehicles is making sense of the data collected by the sensors and using that data to self-drive (Anderson et al. 2016).</p>
											<p>Some are speculating that as autonomous vehicles begin getting more advanced, it is possible that private ownership of these vehicles will increase,
												hence reducing the cost of transportation network companies (TNCs) (Kaplan et al 2019). Self-driving cars will reach out to a wider range of users, hence
												increasing mobility for those who currently have a limited amount of mobility. The number of vehicles on the roads will increase, hence increasing clutter,
												and the ratio of total number of vehicle miles travelled annually against the number of the population is most likely to increase as well (Duarte & Ratti 2018).
												‘AV technologies can decrease the transportation cost and increase accessibility to low-income households and persons with mobility issues’ (Bagloee et al. 2016).
												It is also possible that these vehicles will take up less space on the roads as there will be no need for drivers and hence, no need for a driving seat, steering
												wheel and other equipment needed to drive a car.</p>
												<p>Although some believe that the number of vehicles on the road will increase, hence increasing the clutter, others argue that autonomous vehicles can actually
													help to decrease the number of vehicles on the roads. The fact that shared ownership of autonomous vehicles will be common amongst the users of these vehicles is
													presented as evidence by them (Duarte & Ratti 2018). Hence, the question about the number of vehicles on the roads increasing or decreasing cannot be answered
													until the world witnesses the common use of autonomous vehicles.</p>
												<p>Driverless cars becoming common could lead to a large number of people in the posts of “drivers” to lose their jobs, as Pettigrew, Fritschi, and Norman (2018)
													state in their article, ‘The advent of autonomous vehicles is forecast to bring enormous changes to the workplace as positions primarily involving driving become
													progressively redundant.’ However, it will also introduce many more jobs including original equipment manufacturers (OEM) suppliers, auto dealers, semiconductor
													and battery sectors, entertainment and marketing sectors, and telecom and data management, etc (Giarratana 2018). </p>
													<p>I think that I won’t really be affected much by autonomous vehicles until they become really common on the roads. However, when they do, they’ll
														be super helpful. The thought of getting from place to place without a driver actually excites me a little. You wouldn’t have to worry about road accidents,
														and their damages/ side effects. Driverless cars for me, means one less person in the car, as my family is currently paying a driver to help us get around.
														Learning to drive, especially in Pakistan, is a complete nightmare, as the traffic here is out of control and unmanageable. Driverless cars would make the roads
														a little cleaner, as autonomous vehicles don’t break rules! Travel time will probably be reduced, as the flow of traffic will be more under control and the occurrence
														of traffic jams will become rare. The saved time can be used to do more productive activity. Another benefit is that if you’re getting from place to place without driving,
														you can use the time taken in traveling to get some work done or even enjoy and relax yourself without worrying about road accidents. This will probably lead to a more relaxed
														life as a driving on roads with heavy traffic can be a tension in itself, especially if that road is in Pakistan! I guess this will make getting from place to place easier and
														safer, which means less to worry about when a family member or friend is going out!</p>

																				<h2 class="major">Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies</h2>
																				<p>A Blockchain is a chain of blocks that contains data. A Blockchain is a convey ledger that's totally open to anybody. They have a curious property,
																					once some information has been recorded inside a blockchain, it becomes exceptionally troublesome to alter it. Each block contains some information,
																					the hash of the block and the hash of the past block. The information that's put away inside a block depends on the sort of blockchain. The bitcoin blockchain
																					for example stores the details about an exchange such as the sender, receiver and sums of coins.</p>
																					<p>A block moreover encompasses a hash, you'll be able to compare a hash to a fingerprint. It recognizes a block and all of its substance and its continuously
																					 one of a kind, just as a fingerprint. Once a block is made, it's hash is being calculated. Changing something inside the block causes the hash to alter. Hashes are
																					 valuable after you need to segregate changes to blocks. In the event that the hash of a block changes, it no longer is the same block.</p>
																					 <p>The third component inside each square is the hash of the past square. This successfully makes a chain of squares and it's this strategy that makes a blockchain so secure.
																					 The Creation of Blockchain innovation crested many individuals' interest. Soon, Others realized that the technology could be used for other things like soring medical records, creating a digital notary or even collecting taxes.</p>
																					 <p>Blockchain innovation can be incorporated into numerous fields, for example, Financial administrations, Energy exchanging, Supply Chain, Health care, Anti Counterfeiting, and so
																					 forth The essential utilization of blockchains today is as a disseminated record for cryptographic forms of money, most prominently bitcoin. Different instances of use of Blockchain
																					 have likewise been found in a computer game named 'CryptoKitties' dispatched back in November of 2017. A client of Crypto Kitties sold a virtual pet for all the more then $100,100 United States
																					 Dollars over the Ethereum Network, another Blockchain based Cryptocurrency. Crypto Kitties showed how blockchain can be utilized to inventory game resources.</p>
																					 <p>Researchers in business and the board have begun contemplating the part of blockchains to help joint effort. It has been contended that blockchains can cultivate both participation (avoidance of crafty conduct) and coordination (correspondence and data sharing). On account of unwavering quality, straightforwardness, recognizability of records, and data unchanging nature, blockchains encourage coordinated effort such that contrasts both from the customary utilization of agreements and from social standards. In opposition to contracts, blockchains don't straightforwardly depend on the overall set of laws to uphold arrangements. Also, in opposition to the utilization of social standards, blockchains don't need trust or direct associations between colleagues.
																					 Simultaneously to the flood in the Internet of things, there have been possible settings for Blockchain Technology to locate a home outside of the monetary area in various pertinent situations, remembering those for Healthcare.</p>
																					 <p>Combining adjacent technologies with blockchain will assist us with doing things that haven't been done previously. More reliable information from the blockchain will better illuminate and
																					 reinforce fundamental calculations. Blockchain will help keep that information secure and review every single step in the dynamic cycle, empowering more honed bits of knowledge driven by information that network members trust.</p>
																					 <p>As we have noted, blockchain innovation can moderate the expense of trust, something that shows itself from numerous points of view inside the monetary framework. These costs range generally –
																					 from those related with vault entryways, online protection, settlement systems, client recognizable proof, consistency groups, safety officers and against misrepresentation systems, to the abundance</p>
																					 sums that banks and other unified foundations can charge clients.
																					 <p>Trust exists in the essentials of store banking, care, protection and auxiliary market exchanging. Investors should confide in the wellbeing of their cash at a bank. Market members believe that
																					 their exchanges will be executed genuinely as per a straightforward arrangement of rules. Monetary foundations should believe expensive back-office cycles to accommodate brought together records and bookkeeping frameworks.</p>
																					 <p>With an end goal to address these different costs, DLTs are being investigated by institutional entertainers, for example, huge banks, trades, clearinghouses and, national banks, just as by new firms
																					 looking to upset existing plans of action. Officeholder firms are trusting the innovation can help them lower expenses and dangers, especially for back-office or post-exchange capacities. New companies are meant to give the public
																					 better and lower valued administrations while potentially catching up on the huge monetary rents inside the monetary administrations area.</p>
																					 <p>Also, with the developing public premium in digital currencies and ICOs, numerous organizations are hoping to exploit this blossoming business sector to raise reserves. The monetary administrations area, as
																					 other significant areas of our worldwide economy, has confronted various difficulties and displays a few defects. History is loaded with banking and monetary area emergencies. A huge number of individuals around the
																					 globe lost their positions or their homes because of the 2008 financial crisis. Despite the fact that there is a need to deliberately investigate and consider how appropriation of blockchain advancements and DLTs will influence
																					 monetary solidness, it is additionally worth investigating how these innovations, less dependent on unified establishments, may help fabricate a stronger monetary area.</p>
																					 <p>Unified mediators concentrate chances and regularly can gather critical financial rents. The 2008 financial crisis is nevertheless the most recent token of the long history of moved danger in the monetary
																					 area. Accordingly, current techniques for clearing and settling exchanges, however inconceivably improved from before ages, stay expensive with numerous compromise and counterparty chances. Moreover, numerous monetary
																					 items have high exchange costs and monetary incorporation is lopsided in numerous pieces of the world.</p>
																					 <p>The growth of Blockchain is moving the world towards a transparent and decentralised future. Guaranteeing consumers both trust and privacy when giving out their data to services and corporations and when concluding
																					 transactions. A future where individuals have authority over how their data is handled is the future with Blockchain technology.</p>
																					 <p>Blockchain technology manages logistics, data and other information. With this our lives will change in the way we buy our groceries, funteries and other goods and services. For example in the case of grocery shopping,
																					 big brands can track dates of expirations and source of origins and ensure all finances are on track. Individuals would be able to identify where their food is coming from. </p>

																						<h2 class="major">Cyber security</h2>
																						<p>Since the beginning of sensitive data storage in technology, there has always been a threat by people who want to access this data to use for illegal activity. Over the years these threats have increased and have only reinforced the need for protection of certain information.
																							Cyber security systems are in place to help prevent cyber criminals from exploiting this data. To define cyber security, it is a process that ensures that networks, devices and programs are protected from various cyber-attacks (Johansen 2020). Cyber-attacks are unbiased,
																							targeting anything from large organisations to an ordinary individual. There are various motivations behind these attacks such as monetary gain, revenge or political statements.
																							The progression of technology is constant with the addition of new devices and applications every year. However, technology is not alone in its advancements, cyber criminals are also advancing and have been able to use the same technology as cyber security professionals.
																							Therefore, there is a constant need to update to the most effective cyber security systems in businesses and on personal networks in order to protect important data. </p>
																							<p>For cyber security to achieve its necessary purpose, it relies on three components: IT security, cyber security and computer security (Johansen 2020). The role of IT security is to protect data, both physical and digital,
																						while is being stored as well as when it is moved through a network. Cyber security, a subset of IT security, protects digital data from threats such as unauthorised access, attacks or destruction (Johansen 2020).
																						Computer/network security, a subset of cyber security, protects data from your computer/other devices using hardware and software guarding information that can be prone to cyberattacks (Johansen 2020).
																						 There is no single type of cyber security application, there are multiple. Some of the most well-known include data loss prevention (DLP), protects data through monitoring of information when in use/motion and at rest; cloud security, security for
																						 cloud-based services and applications; and antivirus/anti-malware, a scan performed on computers that searches for threats (Forcepoint n.d).
																						There are also multiple types of threats with some of the most common being malware which includes viruses, spyware and Trojan horses; phising which is often a fraud-related threat that can involve stealing personal data such as credit card information;
																						 and social engineering which is the use of psychological manipulation to gain confidential information (Forcepoint n.d.).</p>
																							 <p>Many technologies have been introduced in order to improve cyber security systems such as artificial intelligence, behavioural analytics, embedded hardware authentication and blockchain cybersecurity (Incognito Forensic Foundation 2019).
																							 Focusing on artificial intelligence (AI), a number of different professions currently incorporate this technology into their businesses. It is a somewhat new technology in the cyber security field and like with all technology, is constantly evolving.
																							 There are already many benefits associated with using this AI in cyber security often achieved with the use of machine learning. Machine learning is a component of AI that assists in detecting and
																							 identifying threats as well as using collected data to improve the function of itself (Lazic 2019). Information from normal user behaviour is observed using machine learning and if a variation occurs in this behaviour, the AI system will detect the
																							 issue. Another benefit of AI is the speed which information can be processed at. If the amount of information was attempted to be processed by a human, the chance that it would be handled as quickly or as effortlessly as AI is low (Lazic 2019).</p>
																							 <p>Often there is a lot of questioning around whether AI will be the future of cyber security or not. In the next few years, AI will only grow in the IT profession with more
																								 organisations investing in a technology that appears to only improve every year. The projected growth for AI technology use for cyber security purposes is USD $38.2 billion by
																								 2026 which is said to be due to ‘the increasing number of connected devices, rising number of cyber threats growing concerns of data pr, and increasing vulnerability of WI-FI
																								 networks to security threats’ (Markets and Markets 2019, para. 1). In terms of technology improvement, there are still currently limitations to what AI technology is able to do such as not being
																								 able to protect the system from other AI technology attacks (Dixon & Farshchi 2019). Hopefully in the near future, issues such as these will be less common. </p>
																							 <p>Although the changes of implementing AI into cyber security have already commenced, it is likely there are more to come. The threat of AI replacing humans in certain professions is often discussed however,
																								 there is also the notion of jobs being altered in order to suit AI needs and this is much more likely. ‘While AI may be great for processing large amounts of data or replacing autonomous manual tasks, it will never be able to
																								 replace a security analyst’s insights or understanding of the field’ (Circadence n.d para. 4). Another reason is that machine-learning tools are unlikely to replace human employment is that humans have create this technology
																								 and therefore human error cannot be ruled out in the design. If something is incorrectly programmed, it would need to reprogrammed by someone capable of doing so as it does not have the capability to do that currently. Furthermore,
																								 these machines need to be regularly evaluated (Palmer 2020). Essentially, people just need to be trained correctly and there need to be appropriate resources to effectively manage and use AI technology in cyber security (Lazic 2019). </p>
																							 <p>If I were to choose to follow a career in cyber security, the continuation of AI advancements could potentially change my role and duties within the industry. Instead of detecting the actual threats, the role may be monitoring the AI systems and analysing the data they produce.
																								 The technology at future workplaces would become more AI dominant and therefore, hopefully, more secure.
																								 If the altered roles are too different to the original, I may even consider choosing a different line of work. However,
																								 it would probably be another IT role and therefore would still be influenced by AI technology. I believe that cyber security systems will only improve from now on and
																								 if the use of AI is the best way to protect networks, no matter how much it affects me, then it is important that it remains a prevalent technology.</p>

																							<h2 class="major">Cloud Services</h2>
																							<p>What is the Cloud? What is Services? These words have been thrown around a lot in this present day, what does it mean? What does it do? ’The term "cloud services" refers to a wide range of services delivered on demand to companies and customers over the internet. These services are designed to provide easy, affordable access to applications and resources, without the need for internal infrastructure or hardware.’ (What is Cloud Computing - Definition - Citrix, 2021). Everybody in some form or another are using cloud services. This can range from a simple email service such as Hotmail to watching online videos via services like YouTube and Netflix. There is currently Three types of cloud services: Software as a Service (SaaS) this is most widely type of cloud service. This involves services such as web-based email, file storage and project management programs.  Next is Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) this as the name says is the infrastructure that houses the servers that support the services for the cloud. Such services are Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud.  Lastly is the Platform as a Service (PaaS) this is where developers can build cloud apps which provides its own database, operating system and programming language.
																							</p>
																							<p>Cloud services offer clients the benefits of lowering their IT costs by offloading hardware, configuration and managing infrastructure. Companies can set up an instant suite of tools pre-configured not having to worry about hardware specifications, whether software will be compatible or even have a long waiting time for hardware and software to arrive. With cloud services/servers' companies can have the option to scale back or up requirements if expansion or cutbacks occur.</p>
																								<p>Quantum computing will be the next evolution to cloud services. Although there is a small amount of company’s providing users access to their quantum computers they are still in its infancy and more research is needed to really bring out the benefits of its power. Due to the nature of quantum computing, analysing data and processing it is completely different to the way traditional computers work now. ‘Traditional computers do calculations using bits: data that exists in one state at a time, a one or a zero. Quantum computers use quantum bits (or "Qbits), which can be zeros, ones or any combination of both, making for much faster processing speeds.’ (Quantum computing could be the next big thing for cloud providers .., 2021)  As more company’s invest more money into quantum computing and provide access to smaller company’s even individuals, this will provide a platform for users to utilise. Quantum computers will most likely be stored in data centres or the company’s own data centre due to quantum computers needing to be stored at a near absolute zero temperatures which is around -273° C to operate. At this state the Qbits have little to no resistance. This is a phenomenon call superposition giving the Qbit a value of 0, 1 or both at the same time. The more Qbits you add, you add more processing power.</p>
																								 <p>As cloud services become more widespread, more and more companies will take up the opportunity to make the transition to cloud-based services. Giving company’s more opportunities to expand to different markets around the world and give users access to more options. Having said that, this doesn’t come with its downside. An example of this would be an online store, local businesses will have to try and compete with the lower costs of the online store or be consumed if they do not adapt. A quote from Bill Gates is “The first rule of any technology used in a business is that automation applied to an efficient operation will magnify the efficiency. The second is that automation applied to an inefficient operation will magnify the inefficiency.” (21 Famous Technology Quotes to inspire you, 2021). If companies move their services to a cloud-based system, they will be at liability of the hosting service. This may lead to unforeseen issues that the company may not be aware of such as, data leaks, selling of user's data.</p>
																								 <p>With prices of both hardware and software rising, the growing demand for cheaper and more convenient ways to access data is becoming to new normal for this day and age. Although access is becoming easier, from a price point of view, services tend to offer discounts for members who pay a yearly fee compared to monthly.  Users will be the ones affected with services moving towards the cloud. Currently there is over 200 streaming media services (The Complete List of Streaming Services - 200+ Services, 2021). Previously users payed a monthly fee for a pay tv type service. The prices varied on what package the user subscribed too. These days pay tv is becoming a thing of the past with streaming services taking the lead. Users now have the option to pay a cheaper monthly fee for unlimited views, add free movies, tv shows as well as music. However, the downside to this is users only have access to limited amount of content. Subscribing to multiple services would be needed to access all your favourite movies and tv shows which can end up costing the user more in the long run.

																								<p>As we have seen over the last decade, since the introduction of cloud-based video services, the old video stores have long become redundant. This in turn left many jobs obsolete and buildings abandoned. Cloud services has mad the modern world more accessible to services that in the past has been an effort for many people. Take music for an example, previously you would need to travel one or another to your local music store to buy a new album from your favourite band. Since the introduction of streaming music services, music is now instant. Alerts now ring when a band has released a new album.</p>
																								<p>Personally, I enjoy having access to my own music store and being able to play music at the touch of a button, change to any style and even share the song instantly with friends. Just like most users, having access to items at the touch of a button has become normal. Over time remembering when I went to the video store to hire a video for only one night. Trying to explain this concept to my grandchildren will make me. reminisce on days gone by. Having family members on your same cloud service account brings instant communications, locations, files or video calls all within the palm of your hand. Long gone are the days where you have to remember friends phone numbers to let them know you have arrived home safe. Now it is instant for the good or the bad, depending on how we adapt this technology it can greatly help humanity, or we will become sceptical to it</p>
