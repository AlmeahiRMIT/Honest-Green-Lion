								<h2>Autonomous Vehicles</h2>
							<p>Self-driving vehicles are cars or trucks in which human drivers are never required to take
								control to safely operate the vehicle. Also known as autonomous or “driverless” cars, they combine
								sensors and software to control, navigate, and drive the vehicle (Union of Concerned Scientists 2017, para. 1). </p>
							<p>For many years, people have been imagining and pondering over the development of autonomous vehicles and we’ve seen them
								in science fictional movies and TV films/ series like the ‘Knight Rider’, Minority Report, and Batman, etc. But they have
								now become a reality with the introduction of IoT – ‘The Internet of Things’.  Autonomous Vehicles are connected to many
								other things, including the on-board sensors, other vehicles on the road, pedestrian and cyclist smart phones, traffic sensors
								(lights etc.), parking detectors, and much more (basically anything that can be found on the roads). IoT can help improve road
								safety of other vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, and even animals. It can help in increasing the flow of the traffic and prevent
								 traffic jams. Maybe even stopping at a red signal can become rare due to IoT! Driving comfort will increase, with the manoeuvrings
								 and navigation becoming smoother, decreasing the chances of sudden brakes..</p>
								<p> As we move on towards the future, the use autonomous vehicles are increasing. Alphabet Inc. has made autonomous taxis. They held
									 a trial session in California where the taxis successfully relocated over 6,200 people during its first month of use. Ford has also
									 been working on self-driving vehicles, carrying out trials in Detroit, Miami, Pittsburgh, Washington D.C. and Palo Alto. They plan on
									 testing their auto vehicles in Austin soon, to be used for taxis and cargo purposes. Another company who has been very successful in
									 in this field is Tesla. ‘Tesla has supplied customers with more than 780,000 vehicles since launching, the majority of which arrive
									 with pre-installed, self-driving capabilities available to users who purchase the requisite software’ (Harris 2020, Para. 4).  Some
									 other companies that are working on autonomous vehicles include: Walmart, which uses autonomous cargo vehicles to deliver goods, and
									 Pizza Hut, who is collaborating with Toyota to make autonomous delivery vans that will have a kitchen inside so that the chef can make
									 pizzas on the way to the delivery homes. (Harris 2020)</p>
									<p>The use of autonomous vehicles is being encouraged to increase the safety of car users and prevent accidents. There are five levels
										of autonomy: driver assistance, partial driving automation, conditional automation, high automation, and full automation. The first
										two levels are where the human supervises the driving environment and as for the last three levels, the automatic system supervises
										the environment (Synopsis Inc. 2021). Majority of autonomous vehicles are at level two autonomy, partial driving automation. Which
										means that the autonomous system has control of steering, accelerating and decelerating the vehicle (Synopsis Inc. 2021). However,
										constant human monitoring is still required for this level, and hence the vehicle cannot be called driverless.</p>
									<p> Future Agenda Limited (2020) have speculated in their report, ‘The future of autonomous vehicles’, that the future of autonomous
										vehicles may be a “wicked problem”. They have described a wicked problem to be one that has many people and opinions involved, and
										knowledge about that problem is incomplete. It cannot be judged when the level of autonomy will increase from level two to three,
										conditional automation, however it is possible that in the next three years, driverless cars may become a part of the discussion of
										the general public.</p>
										<p> The autonomous vehicle system uses a “sense-plan-act” design. A multiple arrangement of sensors is used to detect and sense the environment, some of which include:
											</p>
							<ul><li>LiDAR (Light detection and ranging)</li>
								<li>Cameras</li>
								<li>Radar</li>
								<li>Infrared</li>
								<li>Ultrasonic</li>
								</ul>
							<p>(Anderson et al. 2016)</p>
											<p> A combination of sensors working together reduces the chances of error. The most difficult part to implement in the process of the
												development of autonomous vehicles is making sense of the data collected by the sensors and using that data to self-drive (Anderson et al. 2016).</p>
											<p> Some are speculating that as autonomous vehicles begin getting more advanced, it is possible that private ownership of these vehicles will increase,
												hence reducing the cost of transportation network companies (TNCs) (Kaplan et al 2019). Self-driving cars will reach out to a wider range of users, hence
												increasing mobility for those who currently have a limited amount of mobility. The number of vehicles on the roads will increase, hence increasing clutter,
												and the ratio of total number of vehicle miles travelled annually against the number of the population is most likely to increase as well (Duarte & Ratti 2018).
												‘AV technologies can decrease the transportation cost and increase accessibility to low-income households and persons with mobility issues’ (Bagloee et al. 2016).
												It is also possible that these vehicles will take up less space on the roads as there will be no need for drivers and hence, no need for a driving seat, steering
												wheel and other equipment needed to drive a car.</p>
												<p> Although some believe that the number of vehicles on the road will increase, hence increasing the clutter, others argue that autonomous vehicles can actually
													help to decrease the number of vehicles on the roads. The fact that shared ownership of autonomous vehicles will be common amongst the users of these vehicles is
													presented as evidence by them (Duarte & Ratti 2018). Hence, the question about the number of vehicles on the roads increasing or decreasing cannot be answered
													until the world witnesses the common use of autonomous vehicles.</p>
												<p> Driverless cars becoming common could lead to a large number of people in the posts of “drivers” to lose their jobs, as Pettigrew, Fritschi, and Norman (2018)
													state in their article, ‘The advent of autonomous vehicles is forecast to bring enormous changes to the workplace as positions primarily involving driving become
													progressively redundant.’ However, it will also introduce many more jobs including original equipment manufacturers (OEM) suppliers, auto dealers, semiconductor
													and battery sectors, entertainment and marketing sectors, and telecom and data management, etc (Giarratana 2018). </p>
													<p> I think that I won’t really be affected much by autonomous vehicles until they become really common on the roads. However, when they do, they’ll
														be super helpful. The thought of getting from place to place without a driver actually excites me a little. You wouldn’t have to worry about road accidents,
														and their damages/ side effects. Driverless cars for me, means one less person in the car, as my family is currently paying a driver to help us get around.
														Learning to drive, especially in Pakistan, is a complete nightmare, as the traffic here is out of control and unmanageable. Driverless cars would make the roads
														a little cleaner, as autonomous vehicles don’t break rules! Travel time will probably be reduced, as the flow of traffic will be more under control and the occurrence
														of traffic jams will become rare. The saved time can be used to do more productive activity. Another benefit is that if you’re getting from place to place without driving,
														you can use the time taken in traveling to get some work done or even enjoy and relax yourself without worrying about road accidents. This will probably lead to a more relaxed
														life as a driving on roads with heavy traffic can be a tension in itself, especially if that road is in Pakistan! I guess this will make getting from place to place easier and
														safer, which means less to worry about when a family member or friend is going out!</p>
