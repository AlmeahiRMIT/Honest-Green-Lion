								<h2>Autonomous Vehicles</h2>
							<p>Self-driving vehicles are cars or trucks in which human drivers are never required to take
								control to safely operate the vehicle. Also known as autonomous or “driverless” cars, they combine
								sensors and software to control, navigate, and drive the vehicle (Union of Concerned Scientists 2017, para. 1). </p>
							<p>For many years, people have been imagining and pondering over the development of autonomous vehicles and we’ve seen them
								in science fictional movies and TV films/ series like the ‘Knight Rider’, Minority Report, and Batman, etc. But they have
								now become a reality with the introduction of IoT – ‘The Internet of Things’.  Autonomous Vehicles are connected to many
								other things, including the on-board sensors, other vehicles on the road, pedestrian and cyclist smart phones, traffic sensors
								(lights etc.), parking detectors, and much more (basically anything that can be found on the roads). IoT can help improve road
								safety of other vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, and even animals. It can help in increasing the flow of the traffic and prevent
								 traffic jams. Maybe even stopping at a red signal can become rare due to IoT! Driving comfort will increase, with the manoeuvrings
								 and navigation becoming smoother, decreasing the chances of sudden brakes..</p>
